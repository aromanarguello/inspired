# inspired

Inspired is an app which started as clone (inspired by another site)
The inspiration became a tool I will use to sed send the link other people so they can schedule a meeting by:
1. Entering first and last name
2. Entering Email
3. Entering a message.

Later with the help of a calendar API, I was able to get the user to also schedule a meeting with me at the times I have avaiable since it is synced with my google calendar.

The two columns on the left side are dummy information used to fill the text, soon they will be replaced with various actual topics. 

The Search bar is still not functional
